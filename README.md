## Abstract

Instead of having you write code, for this role it is more essential to be great at reading existing code & documentation and talk about its mechanics/use cases. You can demonstrate the most fundamental skills necessary to succeed in that role: to remember references/understanding business logic and design patterns. To generalize the purpose of service.

Reading code is way more efficient than writing, because it is way faster than writing. Further, it puts you at ease compared to writing code while providing a more meaningful framework to assess your strengths and fit for the role.

## Challenge
One of the main entities in our systems design are our **Shopify instance**, acting as the back office for our eCommerce operations, products inventory and the **processing/ingestion of any transactional events** (e.g. product updates within our inventory) through that instance via a **serverless architecture**. Since our cloud infrastructure is powered by AWS, we are using **AWS EventBridge** and **AWS Lambda** in the mentioned **serverless** domain. 

In order to connect both of those domains, i.e. Shopify and our backend services, it comes in handy that Shopify provides a **built-in EventBridge integration**.


Good luck, enjoy and looking forward to your results walked-thru by you!
