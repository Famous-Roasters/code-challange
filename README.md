## Challenge
One of the main entities in our systems design are our **Shopify instance**, acting as the back office for our eCommerce operations, products inventory and the **processing/ingestion of any transactional events** (e.g. product updates within our inventory) through that instance via a **serverless architecture**. Since our cloud infrastructure is powered by AWS, we are using **AWS EventBridge** and **AWS Lambda** in the mentioned **serverless** domain. 

In order to connect both of those domains, i.e. Shopify and our backend services, it comes in handy that Shopify provides a **built-in EventBridge integration**.


Good luck, enjoy and looking forward to your results walked-thru by you!
